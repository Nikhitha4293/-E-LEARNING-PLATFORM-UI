ðŸ”¹ Description 
This task involves building a multi-page frontend UI for an e-learning platform, mimicking platforms like Coursera or Udemy. The main features include:

Course Listing: Cards showing course name, image, instructor.

Progress Tracking: Visual indicators (like progress bars).

Video Embedding: Embedding learning videos via <iframe>.

The focus is on layout design and UI interactivity using HTML/CSS (you can later connect this with JS or backend). You'll learn to design complex interfaces with modular components and reusable layouts. Itâ€™s an excellent exercise in responsive grids, media content, and clean UI design.
